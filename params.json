It depends on `seq_func.pl`.\r\n\r\nThe following files have sample input and output located in `data/`:\r\n\r\n`read_fasta.pl` reads a multi-record FASTA file and outputs a list of sequence names and lengths.\r\n\r\n`translate_fasta.pl` reads a FASTA file and outputs the 6 possible translations (3 reading frames, forward and reverse complement).\r\n\r\n`pdb_distance.pl` reads a PDB file of a molecule complexed with ADP and outputs a list of every atom within 6 angstroms of the ADP.\r\n\r\n`test_hydrophobic.pl` calls a package that finds the most hydrophobic sequences in a protein. It depends on `Hydrophobic.pm` and `Tmstat.pm`.\r\n\r\n*Another project around the same time used CGI to perform batch BLAST searches of a given sequence against multiple genomes. However, it was a group project so I lack authorization to upload it to github.*\r\n","tagline":"Perl bioinformatics exercises","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
